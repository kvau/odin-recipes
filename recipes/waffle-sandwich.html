        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (or cinnamon)</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups full milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil (or butter)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 tub vanilla ice cream</li>
                <li>Any topping you'd like!</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat waffle iron.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large bowl mix dry ingredients; flour, sugar, baking powder, 
                    and salt.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a separate bowl whisk eggs until fluffy. Add milk, 
                    vegetable oil, and vanilla. Mix to combine.</li>
                <br>  
                <li>Add wet ingredients to dry. Gently mix your batter just until 
                    combined.</li>
                <br>   
                <li>Pour mixture into each section of your waffle iron. Cook until 
                    golden brown (if needed spray waffle iron with non-stick cooking 
                    spray).</li>
                <br>    
                <li>Set waffles aside to cool.</li>
                <br>        
                <li>Take a large tub of ice cream and dump the entire contents out in 
                    one solid piece. Slice 1-inch thick rounds. Using your waffle as 
                    a stencil cut ice cream into desired shapes to fit your waffles. 
                    I did triangles. Sandwich the ice cream between 2 waffles.</li>
                <br>        
                <li>Press the sides of your waffle sandwich (where the ice-cream is 
                    showing) into your desired topping, such as nuts, chocolate chips 
                    or fruit.</li>
                <br>  
                <li>Eat right away, or wrap and freeze for later.</li>
            </ol>
