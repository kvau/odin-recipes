        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the bread dough, and be sure your ingredients are at 
                    room temperature. In the bowl of a mixer, add the heavy cream, milk, 
                    egg, sugar, cake flour, bread flour, yeast, and salt (in that order). 
                    Using the dough hook attachment, turn on the mixer at its lowest 
                    setting.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the 
                    dough together. (Note: if you’re in a humid climate, and the dough is 
                    too sticky, add more flour ¼ cup at a time until the dough comes 
                    together). After 15 minutes, the dough is ready for proofing. Cover 
                    the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The 
                    dough will grow to about 1.5X its original size.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling by thoroughly combining all the filling 
                    ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>After the bread dough has proofed for an hour, put the dough back in 
                    the mixer and knead slowly for another 5 minutes to get rid of air 
                    bubbles. Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 12 
                    equal pieces.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Flatten each piece of dough with your hands into a rough oval shape, 
                    about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. Spread about a tablespoon of 
                    filling onto the middle of the dough, and roll it into a cigar, 
                    tucking the ends under the bun to completely seal the filling in. We 
                    like this method because it evenly distributes the filling throughout 
                    the bun.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Transfer the buns to a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a 
                    clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. For the topping, mix together 1/3 
                    cup cake flour, 3 tablespoons softened butter, and 4 ½ teaspoons 
                    caster sugar, and transfer to a piping bag or small zip top bag with 
                    a small corner cut off. Set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Once the buns have risen, brush with egg wash. Pipe two stripes of 
                    your topping mixture onto each bun, and sprinkle each with sesame 
                    seeds. Bake for 15-17 minutes until golden. Remove from the oven and 
                    brush with the sugar syrup.
                </li>
            </ol>
